        <h1 style="text-align: center;">C. V. Raman</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.5em; border: 1px solid; font-family: Arial; background-color: grey;">Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman was an Indian physicist who made groundbreaking works in the field of light scattering. He was the recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1930 for the discovery that when light traverses a transparent material, some of the light that is deflected changes in wavelength. This phenomenon is now called Raman scattering and is the result of the Raman effect.
