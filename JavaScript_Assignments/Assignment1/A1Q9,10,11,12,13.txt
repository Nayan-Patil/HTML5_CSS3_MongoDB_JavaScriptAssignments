Question 9:
Define a variable x and give it a value of 5. Evaluate x and verify it shows the value.

Ans:
var x=5;
undefined
x;
5


Q10:
Enter this function into the console:
function half(x) {
return(x / 2);
}
Try to predict what you will get for half(x), half(4), and half(3). It is simple to predict what you will
get for half(4), but, depending on your programming background, it might not be so easy to predict
what you will get for half(x) and half(3). Call half(x), half(4), and half(3) and see if you were right.

Ans:
function half(x){
    return (x/2);}
undefined
function half(x){
    return (x/2);} half(x);
2.5
half(3);
1.5
half(4);
2
half(3);
1.5

Q11:
Try to predict what you will get if you evaluate x in the console. Is it still 5, or is it 3?

x
5

Q12:
Enter this function into the console:
function seven() {
x = 7;
return(x);
}
Call seven() in the console.  Try to predict what you will get if you evaluate x in the console. Try it
and see. How do you explain the surprising result?


Ans:

function seven(){
    x=7;
    return(x);
}seven();
7

x
7

Q12:
Make a function called calculation that, given three numbers a, b, and c, returns (a + b)/c. Try it
with a few normal values. Then, try to predict what you will get for calculation(1, 1, 0), calculation(-1, -1, 0), and calculation(1, -1, 0). Try those tests and see if you get what you expected.

Ans:

function calculation(a, b, c){
    return (a+b)/c;
}calculation(1,2,2);
1.5
calculation(1,1,0);
Infinity
calculation(-1,-1,0);
-Infinity
calculation(1,-1,0);
NaN
