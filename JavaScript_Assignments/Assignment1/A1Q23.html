        <h3>Question:    Write a function that rotates a list by k elements. For example [1,2,3,4,5,6]
            rotated by two becomes [3,4,5,6,1,2]. Try solving this without creating a
            copy of the list. How many swap or move operations do you need?  
        </h3>

            Array.prototype.rotateIt = function( n ) {
                this.unshift.apply( this, this.splice( n, this.length ) );
                return this;
            }
