                <li>Question: Make a Rectangle class that stores a width and a height. Make a few instances and print out the
                    properties. Modify a few of the properties and print out the results again.

                <li>Question : Assuming that the Rectangle constructor takes a width and a height, why does the following output
                    20 instead of 200? (Hint: if you see an answer that seems too obvious to be what I am looking for,
                    it probably is the answer I am looking for.)</li>

                <li>Question : Make a variable whose value is an object with firstName and lastName properties, but don’t define
                    a Person class first. Try looking up the first and last names. Try changing the last name. It seems
                    very odd to Java programmers to make an object without first defining a class, but JavaScript programmers do this sort of thing all the time.</li>

                <li>Question : Try reading the middleName property from your variable above. Try assigning to the middleName
                    property. Try reading the property again after you assign to it. Is this behavior a good thing or a bad
                    thing?</li>

                <li>Question : Create a string that contains what looks like an object with firstName and lastName properties. Use
                    “eval” to turn it into a real object, and test it the same way you did with the previous object that you
                    created directly.</li>

                <li>Question : Do the same with JSON.parse. You have to follow strict JSON rules in this case.</li>

                    BankAccount
                   |(accountNumber)
                   |(accountHolderName)

                   -------------------------
                   | |
                   Savings Current
                    (isSalary) (odLimit)
                    Now,
                    create 1 object of savings with accountNumber, accountHolderName, accountBalance and isSalary.
                    create 1 object of currrent with accountNumber, accountHolderName, accountBalance and odLimit.
                    use savings account object to call a function withdraw(amount), that will subtract the amount from the
                    accountBalance, Note that accountBalance should not go below 0.
                    use current account object to calla function withdraw(amount), that will subtract the amount from the
                    accountBalance, Note that accountBalance should not go below negative of odLimit.
                    Now, call getCurrentBalance() from both the object, that will return the accountBalance of the object
                    used to call this method.
