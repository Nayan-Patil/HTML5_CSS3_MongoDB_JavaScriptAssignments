                <li>Question: Make a function called composedValue that takes two functions f1 and f2 and a value and returns
                    f1(f2(value)), i.e., the first function called on the result of the second function called on the value.</li>

                <li>Question : Make a function called compose that takes two functions f1 and f2 and returns a new function that,
                    when called on a value, will return f1(f2(value)). Assume that f1 and f2 each take exactly one argument.</li>

                <li>Question : Make a function called “find” that takes an array and a test function, and returns the first element of
                    the array that “passes” (returns non-false for) the test. Don’t use map, filter, or reduce.</li>

                <li>Question : Recent JavaScript versions added the “map” method of arrays, as we saw in the notes and used in
                    the previous set of exercises. But, in earlier JavaScript versions, you had to write it yourself. Make
                    a function called “map” that takes an array and a function, and returns a new array that is the result
                    of calling the function on each element of the input array. Don’t use map, filter, or reduce.
                    </li>

                <li>Question : Make a “pure” recursive version of find. That is, don’t use any explicit loops (e.g. for loops or the
                    forEach method), and don’t use any local variables (e.g., var x = ...) inside the functions. Hint:
                    remember the slice method of arrays.
                    </li>

                <li>Question : JavaScript lets you define anonymous functions and call them right on the spot. For example,
                    (function(x) { return x*x; })(5) returns 25. Also, if you concatenate a string with a function, the
                    result is a string that looks more or less like the function definition. </li>
